<h1>A .NET Core Web API with a MySql Database</h1>

<p>The code included here will build a web API that can be accessed by a Reactjs or Nextjs (or similar) web app.</p>

<p>Much of the real instruction, as I've learned it, is in the file scaffoldcontroller.txt</p>

<p>It provides just two DB tables/Models, but if you understand EntityFrameworkCore migrations, you can alter it 
fairly easily</p>

<p>Any major alterations, such as adding a table, would require running the ASPNet code generation tool to create/correct the 
controllers.</p>

<p>I have only tested it through my first couple of migrations and that Swagger works.</p>

<p>You are welcome to use it at your own risk.  Read up on Entity Framework Core migrations and the ASPNet code generation tool</p>
